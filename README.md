# Classify and Cluster SMS Messages

## Description

Use Bayesian classification and K-means clustering to analyze SMS messages.

## Details

This repo contains two IPython (Jupyter) Notebooks reflecting my work on this project.
sms2.ipynb contains the second and better attempt at classifying spam. 
sms-spam.ipynb is still here for my own reference, or for you if you want to watch me fail.  :)

## Deliverables

Download the [SMS Spam collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Choose a set of features to use in order to separate SMS ham from spam.

Write a program to extract the features you want from each SMS message and then classify each SMS as ham or spam. Iterate on your feature extraction until you
have a classification success level you are comfortable with (> 75% minimum.)
